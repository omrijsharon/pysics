# pysics
Physics simulations with controllable objects (games) for practicing multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms (MARLA). Compatible with openAI gym package.

## Work in progress.

- Even though most of the environments are compatible with gym, the multi-agent environments requires different coding.



## Environments:
- [x] Spaceship
- [x] Unstable1D
- [x] Unstable2D
- [x] GravityBalance
- [x] RodGravityBalance
- [ ] Painter
- [ ] Darts
- [ ] FireCannon
- [ ] NavigationGame01
- [x] PlayTogether
- [x] Drone2Dsim
